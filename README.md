# SmartGlove

SmartGlove is a Project writtin in C++. It is about connecting a glove to a Robotic hand that can then be controlled wirelessly by the Glove. Both the Glove and the Robotic arm contain a Microcontroller each.
through the Bluetooth chip on both controllers, a communication is built between the two. Flex sensors are responsable for capturing movement each finger in the glove and moving the motots attached to the Robotic arm.
